# Statsify

Statsify is a powerful application that leverages the capabilities of CrewAI and Perplexity to provide users with insightful visualizations and dashboards for any statistical query they might have. Whether it's exploring population demographics, analyzing sports data, or delving into economic trends, Statsify empowers users to obtain comprehensive visualizations tailored to their specific interests.

## How Statsify Works

Statsify follows a structured approach to generate informative dashboards based on user queries:

1. **Query Deconstruction**: The user's query is deconstructed and expanded upon to identify the specific statistic(s) required.

2. **Question Generation**: Statsify generates additional questions to gather relevant data and provide a broader context for the requested statistic(s).

3. **Online Search**: Leveraging Perplexity, Statsify conducts online searches to find the necessary statistics and data points.

4. **Knowledge Base Construction**: All relevant data is compiled into a comprehensive knowledge base within the agents' scratchpad.

5. **Visualization Code Generation**: Statsify generates Python code to create customized widgets, charts, and visualizations based on the gathered data.

6. **Dashboard Output**: The final output is a visually appealing dashboard or image containing the requested statistical visualizations, providing users with a clear and concise representation of the queried data.

Statsify streamlines the process of obtaining statistical insights by combining the power of natural language processing, online data retrieval, and data visualization techniques, all within a seamless user experience.
